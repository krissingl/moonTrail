  "introVerbiage": "ON YOUR WAY BACK FROM A SUCCESSFUL MISSION TO MARS, YOUR SPACECRAFT LOST CONTROL OF ITS FLIGHT SYSTEMS AND WAS THROWN INTO A METEOR FIELD. AFTER TAKING DAMAGE FROM SEVERAL METEOR IMPACTS, YOUR CREW MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING ON THE MOON. YOUR CREW MUST TRAVEL BY ROVER TO AN OLD LANDING SITE WHERE A BACK-UP SPACECRAFT IS WAITING. YOU MUST FIND THE QUICKEST AND SAFEST ROUTE TO THE OLD LANDING SITE AND ESCAPE THE MOON BEFORE RESOURCES RUN OUT. STRATEGICALLY CHOOSE THE ROVER, SUPPLIES, AND ROUTE THAT WILL ASSURE THE HIGHEST POSSIBILITY OF SURVIVAL FOR YOUR CREW. THE MISSION ENDS WHEN EITHER THE ENTIRE CREW HAS PERISHED, OR AT LEAST ONE CREW MEMBER REACHES THE OLD LANDING SITE AND ESCAPES. YOU WILL RECEIVE A POINT SCORE FOR WHATEVER SURVIVES THE JOURNEY."
